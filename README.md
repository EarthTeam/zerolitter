## Bags In Trees

**Mapping Plastic Bag Pollution Around the World**

Every Instagram photo of a plastic bag in a tree, tagged with #bagsintrees, is displayed on our bag map. Using this map, we'll be able to see the extent of plastic pollution in trees throughout the world.

Only a small percentage of the plastic bags that litter our cities become caught in trees. These bags in trees serve as an indicator of the level of plastic bag pollution in a given area.

Cities throughout The United States and other countries are moving to ban or dis-incentivize the use of plastic bags. Most recently, the state of California just passed legislation preventing grocery stores from using plastic bags. Data from Bags In Trees can be used by groups promoting such causes to show the prevelance and distribution of bags in their area.

Bags In Trees data can also be used to highlight cities with plastic bag bans by showing the relative scarcity of plastic bag pollution in trees.


Cities can leverage the geo-tagged data of plastic bags in trees to locate and remove plastic bags.
