        <h4>About Bags In Trees</h4>
        <p>Several years ago, my daily walk to work took me along Atlantic Ave, a main thouroughfare in the city of Boston. One day, for whatever reason, I looked up and noticed a plastic bag attached to a branch in tree along the side of the road. It waved back and forth in the wind, trapped by the branches. I walked past that same bag day after day, thinking "surely the city goes around and plucks them out of the trees." Spring came and my bag was obscured by the leaves of the tree and I forgot about it. Come Autum, the tree shed its foliage and my bag was visible again, looking no worse for wear.</p>

        <p>I began to see bags in trees everywhere I went. Nobody was cleaning them up. Heck, nobody was even noticing them! While I wasn't about to rent a big pole and drive around Boston pulling bags out of trees, I thought I could at least bring the issue to light. Bags In Trees is my attempt to shed light on the issue of plastic pollution.</p>
